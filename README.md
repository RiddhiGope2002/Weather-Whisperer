# Weather-Whisperer
Weather Whisperer is not just a Python project, it's a seamless experience of obtaining real-time weather data through voice commands. From April 2022 to June 2022, I crafted this project to provide accurate and accessible weather information while emphasizing user-friendliness and advanced error handling.
