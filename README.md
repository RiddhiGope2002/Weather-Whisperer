🌦️ Voice-Enabled Weather App

🎯 Overview
This Voice-Enabled Weather App is built using Python and provides real-time weather updates for any city in the world. It uses a weather API to fetch the latest data and pyttsx3 for converting weather reports into speech, making it fully voice-interactive.

🔊 Just run the app, speak your city, and let it tell you the current weather!

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python	Core programming
requests	API calls
json	Parsing API responses
pyttsx3	Voice synthesis
Weather API	Real-time weather info

🖥️ How It Works
User inputs or speaks the name of the city.
The app sends a request to a Weather API (like OpenWeatherMap).
The response is parsed and important weather details are extracted.
The app uses pyttsx3 to speak the weather details aloud.
